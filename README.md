# Control-Systems

Open-loop vs. Closed-loop systems
Feedback and feedforward control
PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control
Stability analysis (e.g., using Bode plots or root-locus)

Transfer functions and state-space representation
Stability and natural frequency
Transient response (how quickly a system reaches steady state)
