# **Project 2: Drone Attitude Control (PID)**  

üèóÔ∏è **Objective:**  
Develop a **PID controller** to stabilize and control a drone‚Äôs **pitch, roll, and yaw**. Each axis will be modeled as a **second-order system**, and a PID controller will be tuned for stability.

## **Step 1: Dynamics of a Single Axis (Roll/Pitch/Yaw)**  
For a simplified drone model, each axis behaves like a **second-order system**:

The transfer function representation:

where:  
- Œò(s) = Angular position (roll, pitch, or yaw)  
- M(s) = Control torque applied by drone motors  
- J = Moment of inertia  
- b = Aerodynamic damping  

For a single axis, the system can be approximated as a **second-order transfer function**:

## **Step 2: Implement in Simulink/Python**  
- **Simulink:** Use a **second-order system block** and apply a **PID controller block**.  
- **Python:** Use `control.TransferFunction()` to model the system and `control.step_response()` to visualize the response.

## **Step 3: PID Controller Design**  

### **Manual Tuning Approach**  
- **Proportional Gain (K‚Çö)**: Increases speed but may introduce overshoot.  
- **Integral Gain (K·µ¢)**: Reduces steady-state error but may cause oscillations.  
- **Derivative Gain (Kd)**: Reduces overshoot and stabilizes.  

#### **Tuning method:**  
1. Start with only K‚Çö to get an initial response.  
2. Add Kd to reduce overshoot.  
3. Introduce K·µ¢ to remove steady-state error.

### **Auto-Tuning Using Ziegler-Nichols**  
1. Set K·µ¢ = 0, Kd= 0 .  
2. Increase K‚Çö until the system **oscillates**.  
3. Use oscillation period T·µ§ to calculate optimal PID gains:

## **Step 4: Performance Evaluation**  
‚úî **Step Response Analysis:** Check rise time, overshoot, and settling time.  
‚úî **Bode Plot Stability Analysis:** Verify gain and phase margins.  
‚úî **Disturbance Rejection:** Introduce **wind disturbances** and check stability.

## **Possible Extensions**  
üîπ Implement **nonlinear model** including motor dynamics.  
üîπ Introduce **sensor noise** (simulate IMU errors).  
üîπ Design an **adaptive PID controller** (self-tuning PID).
